File: agents/questions_generator/agent.py
Purpose: Defines the Questions Generator Agent that takes a user-provided topic and generates 
         five important questions to help understand that topic. This agent uses Google search 
         to research the topic before generating informed questions.

This is the first agent in the website building pipeline that:
1. Receives a topic from the user
2. Researches the topic using Google search
3. Generates exactly 5 questions that help understand the topic
4. Outputs the questions for the questions_researcher agents to answer
